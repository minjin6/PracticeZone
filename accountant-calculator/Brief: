Brief:

The Task I want to do I to create a visual receipt. This task so be quite straight forward.

As a user I want to:
• Add my item and price line by line.
• Price should be entered on prompt
• Items should be listed visual as if it is on a receipt piece of paper
• At the end I want to press a button to get me sub total and total (complete total includes VAT).
• Vat is 20%
• If I made a mistake in the price I would like to go back and make an edit to a price and then the new total is recaluted
• Prince in £ currency
